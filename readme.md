### HAW Challenge

This is my entry as the programming task for the digital reality masters programme at the HAW.

I set myself the task to not rely on frameworks like unity, as I have used it in the past and have heard good things about three.js.







learnings:

nose is more suitable for steering, since the face must otherwise always stay parallel to the camera.
Humans tend to lead movement with their nose



closure is a mess in standard JS/TS. A framework like react would have been more suitable


The lack of easy physics makes THREE.js difficult for 3d games.


TODO:

distance from center approach for acceleration
(instead of bounding box and exponential acelleration)
This allows more precise controls




self written collider

self written control logic

self written acceleration logic
